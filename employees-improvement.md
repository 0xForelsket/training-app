# Employee Profile Improvement Ideas

- Add an “Edit Profile” drawer for quick updates to department, shift, and contact information without leaving the page.
- Surface recent training activity (last 5 validations) in a timeline so supervisors can spot acceleration or stagnation trends.
- Introduce KPI chips (e.g., number of validated skills, assignments overdue, upcoming recertifications) at the top for fast scanning.
- Show a photo/ID badge area with “Print License” and “Copy Profile Link” buttons to streamline shop-floor checks.
- Embed a “Notes & Coaching Log” section where trainers can add contextual feedback tied to the employee’s progression.
- Provide export options (PDF license, CSV training summary) so HR can share records externally in one click.
